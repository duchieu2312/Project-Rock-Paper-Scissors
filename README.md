# Rock Paper Scissors – JavaScript Learning Project

## 📌 Introduction

This is a small project built to **practice core JavaScript concepts**, including:

- Functions
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Variable scope (local vs global)
- User input using `prompt()` and `alert()`
- Basic data structures (arrays)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand fundamental JavaScript syntax and logic
- Learn how to break a program into smaller functions
- Handle user input and validate it
- Build a simple interactive console-based game

---

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser
2. A prompt will ask you to enter `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`
3. The computer will randomly choose its move
4. The result will be printed to the **browser console**
5. The game consists of 5 rounds, and the winner is announced at the end

> 💡 **Note:** Open your browser's **Console (F12)** to see the output.
